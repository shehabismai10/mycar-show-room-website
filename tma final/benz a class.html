        <br>
        The 2022 Mercedes-Benz A-class is a small car with the heart of an S-class luxury sedan. The expensive-looking fa√ßade helps it look right at home among the rest of the Benz lineup, and its modern, tech-filled cabin delivers much the same experience as pricier models. A turbocharged four-cylinder drives either the front or all four wheels, and the A-class's handling is fairly spry. We'll admit that it's not as quick as the related AMG-tuned CLA35, but it's still engaging to drive. Compared to rivals such as the BMW 2-series Gran Coupe and the Cadillac CT4,
         the A-class offers a more cohesive package and is more desirable than either of those entry-level luxury compact cars.so the price is: 1,565,000 EGP</div>
