        <br>
        Mercedes-Benz's entry-level sports sedan has been thoroughly redesigned for the 2022 model year but the C-class sticks with its winning formula of luxury and prestige at an affordable price. The modernization gives the C-class what it needs to better battle rivals such as the Audi A4, BMW 3-series, and Genesis G70. The cabin is where we see the most modernization, as the C-class inherits styling elements and technology from the S-class sedan. Like the outgoing C-class, the 2022 model is built on a rear-drive platform, is powered by a turbocharged four-cylinder engine, and offers all-wheel drive as an option. Handling is confident and the C-class can easily be hustled through twisty bits of road, but we've found the ride to be unforgiving over rough patches of pavement and the steering less communicative than the car's sports-sedan mission requires. Besides its dynamic shortcomings,
         the C-class continues the tradition of mimicking the style and substance of the flagship S-class sedan in a smaller, more affordable package.So the price is: 970,000 EGP
