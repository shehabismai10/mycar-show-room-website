        <br>
        Although the nameplate originally was used on a less-than-stellar compact car line in the 1970s, Ford has revived the Maverick name 
        for its new small pickup truck, and has slotted it into the lineup below the mid-size Ranger. This time, the Maverick is an impressive package worthy of an Editors' Choice award. Instead of sharing parts and mechanicals with the Ranger, the Maverick rides on the same chassis as the Bronco Sport compact crossover. The standard powertrain is a hybrid setup that consists of a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine, an electric motor, a continuously variable automatic transmission, and front-wheel drive. Ford also offers all-wheel drive, but only with the optional nonhybrid turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder engine. All models sport the same four-door crew cab body style with a 4.5-foot bed.
         The Maverick is part of a new class of small pickup trucks that Hyundai is also entering with the upcoming Santa Cruz.
        So the price is: 534,720 EGP</div>
