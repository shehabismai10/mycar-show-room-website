        <br>
        The 2022 Ford Bronco rocks a nostalgia-inducing design along with both civil on-road driving manners and big-time trail-tackling ability. The sheer bandwidth of its capabilities is what makes Ford's off-roader such a hit. While the Jeep Wrangler has ruled the off-road world as the de facto SUV for people seeking a vehicle with bona fide trail-eating cred—even if they never plan to tackle a boulder-strewn two-track—the Bronco is similarly configurable with a convertible top, two- and four-door body styles, and removable doors. Inside, the durable materials and simple design recall the original, old-school Bronco, but the interior aesthetic looks cheap on upper trim levels. All Broncos have all-wheel drive and either a turbo-four or a twin-turbo V-6. Neither are very fuel-efficient or sound particularly pleasant, but they're quick and responsive. The optional Sasquatch and Everglades packages—beefier tires and other enhancements—help make the 2022 Bronco
         the ultimate off-road SUV and earn it a spot on both our 10Best and Editors' Choice lists.
        So the price is: 1,272,000 EGP</div>
