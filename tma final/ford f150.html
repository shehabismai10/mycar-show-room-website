            <div class="heading">About 2022 Ford F-150 :</div>
        <br>
        With a wide range of trims and body styles, the 2022 Ford F-150 is a workhorse that can be outfitted to suit any number of tasks. 
        Contractors and fleet managers will appreciate the low-cost and utilitarian nature of the base XL while oil barons and wealthy ranch owners will feel right at home in the King Ranch or Limited versions. A host of powertrains are offered too, including a hybrid and a diesel, and an off-road ready Tremor model promises to take you nearly anywhere you need to go. The F-150 has the grit to get the job done. It's not quite as nice to live with on a daily basis as its chief rival, the Ram 1500, but huge numbers of buyers have historically been swayed by the Ford's reputation and wider range of available features. Weâ€™re sure very few of them have regretted their purchase, so we're happy to put the F-150 on our Editors'
         Choice list.
        So the price is: 1,819,920 EGP</div>
