        <br>
        The 2022 Toyota Camry shares a nameplate with the generations that came before, but its extroverted styling
         and performance model make it almost unrecognizable. That's because the current Camry
          is arguably the most compelling it has ever been. The standard, albeit humdrum, four-cylinder
           engine is economical and fine for daily driver duty. The hybrid version maximizes fuel economy, even if its acceleration is uneventful. That leaves the lusty 301-hp V-6 to pick up the pace, especially on the sport-tuned Camry TRD, which is actually entertaining to drive. While rivals like the Honda Accord and Hyundai Sonata are more refined and satisfying overall, the Toyota has its own desirable qualities, such as a full suite of standard active safety features and goodwill
         generated by decades of proven reliability.. So the price is: 2,515,000 EGP
