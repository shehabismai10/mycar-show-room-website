        <br>
        The 2022 Mercedes-Benz GLC300 coupe rides high like an SUV but looks more dramatic thanks to its diving rear roofline. The latter impinges on cargo space and back-seat headroom, but that's the price of admission nowadays to the beauty pageant among compact luxury utes. The sloped-back Benz competes directly with the Audi Q5 Sportback, the BMW X4, and the Infiniti QX55. Inside, the GLC's passengers enjoy an upscale environment with fancy standard features aplenty. Under the Benz's hood is a 255-hp turbo-four powertrain that teams with standard all-wheel drive. While the 2022 GLC300 has a supple ride and nimble handling,
         it's not as exciting as its souped-up siblings, the Mercedes-AMG GLC43 and GLC63.so the price is: 1,420,000 EGP</div>
