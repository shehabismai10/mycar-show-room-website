Toyota claims the Corolla SX uses 6.0L/100km of Unleaded Petrol in the combined city and highway cycle while putting out 139g of CO2. It has a 50L fuel tank, meaning it should be able to travel 833km per full tank.

The Corolla SX comes standard with 205/55 R16 front tyres and 205/55 R16 rear tyres. It requires a service every 12 months or 15,000 km, whichever comes first. It has a 60 month, unlimited kilometre warranty.
