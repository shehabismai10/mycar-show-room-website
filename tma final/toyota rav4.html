        <br>
        There are good reasons why the RAV4 is a perennial bestseller for 
        Toyotaâ€”it's a practical and efficient SUV that appeals to your common sense.
         The 2023 RAV4 continues the tradition, with a cargo-friendly interior, an attractive base price,
          and sensible road manners. A 2.5-liter four-cylinder drives the front or all four wheels through an eight-speed automatic transmission.
           Acceleration is somewhat poky, but fuel economy is good.
            A hybrid and a plug-in-hybrid powertrain are also available,
             but we review those models separately.
              The RAV4's rugged looks allow it to look at home among 4Runners and Tacomas,
               but even the most capable TRD Off-Road model isn't going to make it to the same remote locales as those more rugged off-roaders.
                The RAV4 is at its best when it's tackling more suburban tasks, such as daily commuting and trips to the home improvement store.
                 Toyota includes a host of driver-assistance tech and desirable infotainment features as standard, which helps bolster the RAV4's value
                  relative to its rivals.. So the price is:2,200,000 EGP
