        <br>
        The 2022 Toyota Tacoma is terrific for work duties and fantastic for off-roading, but its small interior and driving manners are less refined than most other mid-size pickups. While it's the only one that still offers a manual transmission, its anemic four-cylinder and 270-hp V-6 deliver unremarkable performance; a six-speed automatic is optional but isn't particularly refined. At least the Tacoma is backed by Toyota's storied reliability, and its off-road-optimized models are especially capable. It flourishes in the mud and on the trails, with a flexible suspension and rugged equipment that help preserve its reputation alongside legends such as the Jeep Wrangler and now its pickup counterpart, the Gladiator. The 2022 Tacoma isn't as customizable as the Jeeps, and it doesn't drive as well as the Chevy Colorado and GMC Canyon, but the Taco is tough and packed with standard driver-assistance tech.
         
         So the price is: 1,200,000 EGP
