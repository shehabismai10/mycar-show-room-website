        <br>
        If a full-size F-150 is larger and more capable than you need, the 2022 Ford Ranger is the mid-size Ford-brand pickup truck that should suit your lifestyle without draining your bank account. Instead of its bigger brother's V-6 and V-8 powertrains, the Ranger makes do with a turbocharged 2.3-liter four-cylinder and a 10-speed automatic transmission; rear-wheel drive is standard but all-wheel drive is available across the lineup. Towing and payload capacities are stout and are competitive with other mid-size pickups such as the Chevrolet Colorado and the GMC Canyon. If youâ€™re looking for off-road capability, the Tremor model is your best bet for now, but we're still hoping Ford will come through with a Ranger Raptor model that will bring more performance to the
         equation.
        So the price is: 1,200,000 EGP</div>
